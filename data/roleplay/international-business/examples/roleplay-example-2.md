**ROLE PLAY SITUATION**

[Background Information]{.underline}

Your company is a major exporter of fresh, wild-caught Norwegian salmon.
Your company sells predominantly to local fish markets and large
wholesale seafood distributors in the Northeastern United States. You
also cater to a small group of high-end restaurants that will pay a
premium for the best quality fish. Each year the supply can fluctuate by
much as 20 percent. Your company tries to keep prices as level as
possible for all its customers.

[Scenario]{.underline}

Over the past five years, the federal government has increased the
tariffs on all salmon imported to the United States by an average of 2
percent each year. The goal of the increase has been to force a larger
portion of salmon to be purchased from domestic sources. The Alaskan
salmon distributors have successfully lobbied legislators to implement
these tariffs in order to gain market share and increase the yields in a
highly competitive market. Your challenge is to present both the
positives and negatives of tariffs as you interact with the judges.
Members should be able to present at least three positive and three
negative end results from tariffs.

[Other Useful Information]{.underline}

- Be able to explain the importance of international trade.

- Communicate potential risks associated with international trade of
  perishable items.

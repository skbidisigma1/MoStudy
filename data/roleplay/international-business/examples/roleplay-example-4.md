**ROLE PLAY SCENARIO**

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong><u>Background</u></strong></p>
<p>You work for a custom workwear solutions company. This company has an
established manufacturing facility in the United States within a
reasonable distance to its largest customers. Your company manufactures
clothing for the work environment focusing on comfort, safety, and
efficiency. The company includes apparel and safety footwear. The
company also offers customization of products to meet a customer’s image
and logo requirements.</p>
<p><strong><u>Scenario</u></strong></p>
<p>You are the manager of business development and your largest customer
is interested in your company providing products to their European
division. This new line of business would be opening you up to
international market opportunities. Due to regulations, for you to sell
the products in the market, you would need to open and operate a
facility in the European Union. Financially, the increase in business
with this one customer would offset the start-up cost for the additional
location. You are preparing a short presentation to share with the board
(judges) about this opportunity. Explain the impact international
business could have on your company. Create a list of rewards and risks
related to international expansion. Finally, describe how geography and
location of the new facility might impact your business.</p></td>

the United States, two in Europe, three in Asia, and one in South
America. The company has been in operation for 15 years and has a staff
of nearly 2000 individuals. The company focuses on recruiting the best
software designers, engineers, programmers, and other technology
specialists to develop cutting edge cybersecurity software technology.
The company is publicly traded and is led by a twelve-member board of
directors. For the past three years, UITI has been developing a new
software program under a United States government contract and began
testing it a year ago. The company has included a provision of the
